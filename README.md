Requests for login and signup, respectively are expected to be in the form: 

fetch("localhost:3000/login?email=ab@cd.com&password=123abc")

AND

fetch("localhost:3000/signup?name=Johnson&email=ab@cd.com&password=123abc")

All responses will be in JSON format

Responses for succesful login or signup will be in this format:

{
	data:
		{
		
			"name": "Johnson",
			"email": "abc.xyz.com",
			"password": "abc123"
		}
}

	data:
	
		{
		
			"code": NUMBER,
		}
}
